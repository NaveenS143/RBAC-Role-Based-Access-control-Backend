# Auth_rbac

## Description

This project implements a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system using **Node.js** and **MongoDB**. It provides a secure authentication and authorization mechanism where users can be assigned roles, and roles determine the permissions to access resources.

## Features

- User authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based access to endpoints
- Secure password storage using bcrypt
- Modular structure for scalability
- Environment variable management with dotenv

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas cluster)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/auth_rbac.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd auth_rbac
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define the following variables:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

## Usage

### Run in Development Mode
Start the application with Nodemon:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### API Endpoints
Define your API endpoints in the `routes/` directory. Example endpoints might include:
- `POST /login`: User login
- `GET /resource`: Fetch resource data (with role-based access control)

## Dependencies

- **bcryptjs**: For hashing passwords.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
- **express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For JWT-based authentication.
- **mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling.
